# Terebigemu-DatabaseProject
Project from April 2020 that used php, sql, phpmyadmin, and HTML/CSS

Updated version of Terebigemu.net-Project which only used HTML/CSS. I used XAMPP and Phpmyadmin in order to make this work. 
Of course, my database login has long been deleted. This is only here to showcase proficiency in SQL & PHP when it comes to database design & implementation
